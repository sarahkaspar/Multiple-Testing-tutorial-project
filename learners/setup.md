## Summary

At the end of this course, you will be able to:

- comprehend the concept of multiple testing and its implications, including the increased likelihood of observing low p-values by chance.
- be able to differentiate between different types of errors, (false positives and false negatives) and understand their significance in various research contexts.
- understand how family-wise error rate (FWER) arises in multiple testing scenarios and grasp methods like the Bonferroni procedure for controlling it.
- gain proficiency in interpreting adjusted p-values resulting from FWER correction and applying them in statistical analyses like ANOVA and post-hoc tests.
- appreciate the challenges posed by high-dimensional data and understand the importance of controlling FDR using methods like the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.
- apply the concepts learned to real-world scenarios, such as analyzing RNA-Seq data by selecting appropriate error rates and methods based on their research questions.
- acquire a structured approach to selecting error rates and methods tailored to their research objectives and data characteristics, enhancing the rigor and validity of their statistical analyses.

## Tools Required

- Statistical software R ([download](https://cran.r-project.org/))
- Basic knowledge of programming in R is beneficial for understanding the coding examples.

## Data Sets 

- For simulation and demonstration purposes, you may use synthetic datasets generated within the tutorial or any relevant datasets from your field of study.
- Optionally, you can use RNA-Seq data with a large number of genes (e.g., 20,000 human genes) to illustrate the challenges of multiple testing correction for high-dimensional data.

## Preparation

Ensure that R is installed and functional on your system. Familiarize yourself with basic statistical concepts such as hypothesis testing, p-values, and ANOVA, as these will provide a foundation for understanding multiple testing procedures.
