## Summary

At the end of this course, you will be able to:

- comprehend the concept of multiple testing and its implications, including the increased likelihood of observing low p-values by chance.
- be able to differentiate between different types of errors, (false positives and false negatives) and understand their significance in various research contexts.
- understand the concept of family-wise error rate (FWER) multiple testing scenarios and grasp methods like the Bonferroni procedure for controlling it.
- gain proficiency in interpreting adjusted p-values resulting from FWER correction and applying them in statistical analyses like ANOVA and post-hoc tests.
- appreciate the challenges posed by high-throughput data analysis and understand the importance of controlling FDR using methods like the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. 
- apply the concepts learned to real-world scenarios, such as analyzing RNA-Seq data by selecting appropriate error rates and methods based on their research questions.


## Tools Required

- Statistical software R ([download](https://cran.r-project.org/))
- Basic knowledge of programming in R is beneficial for understanding the coding examples.

## Data Sets 

For all example data in this lesson, links for downloading them are provided during the episodes, which will allow you to follow along with coding. 


## Preparation

For the coding exercises, you'll need internet connection for loading libraries and data.
Ensure that R is installed and functional on your system. Familiarize yourself with basic statistical concepts such as hypothesis testing, and p-values as these will provide a foundation for understanding multiple testing procedures.
